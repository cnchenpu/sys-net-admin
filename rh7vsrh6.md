# Major differences between RHEL 7 and 6

Features | RHEL 7 | RHEL 6
---|---|---
Default File | System | XFS | EXT4
Kernel Version | 3.10.x-x kernel | 2.6.x-x Kernel
First Process | systemd (process ID 1) | init (process ID 1)
Run Level | runlevels are called as "targets" as shown below: <br> runlevel0.target -> poweroff.target <br> runlevel1.target -> rescue.target <br> runlevel2.target -> multi-user.target <br> runlevel3.target -> multi-user.target <br> runlevel4.target -> multi-user.target <br> runlevel5.target -> graphical.target <br> runlevel6.target -> reboot.target <br> ```/etc/systemd/system/default.target``` (this by default is linked to the multi-user.target OR graphical.target) | Traditional runlevels defined: <br> runlevel 0 <br> runlevel 1 <br> runlevel 2 <br> runlevel 3 <br> runlevel 4 <br> runlevel 5 <br> runlevel 6 <br> and the default runlevel would be defined in ```/etc/inittab``` file.
Host Name Change | In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, as part of the move to the new init system (systemd), the hostname variable is defined in ```/etc/hostname``` file. | In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, the hostname variable was defined in the ```/etc/sysconfig/network``` configuration file.
File System Check | ```xfs_repair``` <br> XFS does not run a file system check at boot time. | ```e2fsck``` File system check would gets executed at boot time.
Differences Between xfs_repair & e2fsck | ```xfs_repair``` <br> - Inode and inode blockmap (addressing) checks. <br> - Inode allocation map checks. <br> - Inode size checks. <br> - Directory checks. <br> - Pathname checks. <br> - Link count checks. <br> - Freemap checks. <br> - Super block checks. | ```e2fsck``` <br> - Inode, block, and size checks. <br> - Directory structure checks. <br> - Directory connectivity checks. <br> - Reference count checks. <br> - Group summary info checks.
Boot Loader | GRUB 2 <br> Supports GPT, additional firmware types, including BIOS, EFI and OpenFirmware. Ability to boot on various file systems (xfs, ext4, ntfs, hfs+, raid, etc) | GRUB 0.97
System & Service Manager | Systemd <br> ```systemd``` is a system and service manager for Linux, and replaces SysV and Upstart used in previous releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. ```systemd``` is compatible with SysV and Linux Standard Base ```init scripts```. | Upstart
Enable/Start Service | For RHEL 7, the ```systemctl``` command replaces ```service``` and ```chkconfig```. <br> - Start Service: ```systemctl start nfs-server.service```. <br> - Enable Service : To enable the service (example: nfs service ) to start automatically on boot : ```systemctl enable nfs-server.service```. <br> Although one can still use the service and chkconfig commands to start/stop and enable/disable services, respectively, they are not 100% compatible with the RHEL 7 ```systemctl``` command. | Using ```service``` command and ```chkconfig``` commands. <br> - Start Service : "service nfs start" OR "/etc/init.d/nfs start" <br> - Enable Service : To start with specific runlevel. E.q.: ```chkconfig --level 3 5 nfs on```.
Default Firewall | Firewalld <br> The built-in configuration is located under the ```/usr/lib/firewalld``` directory. The configuration that you can customize is under the ```/etc/firewalld``` directory. It is not possible to use ```firewalld``` and ```iptables``` at the same time. But it is still possible to disable ```firewalld``` and ```iptables``` as before. | Iptables
