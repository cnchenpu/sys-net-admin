# Working with GRUB 2
- The GRUB 2 configuration file ```grub.cfg``` location:
  - BIOS machines: ```/boot/grub2/grub.cfg``` 
  - UEFI machines: ```/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg```
- The GRUB 2 configuration file ```grub.cfg``` generation:
  - created during installation
  - regenerated by running the ```grub2-mkconfig``` command
    - according to the template files in ```/etc/grub.d/```, and custom settings in the ```/etc/default/grub``` file.
  - automatically updated by ```grubby``` each time a new kernel is installed
- Edits of ```grub.cfg``` will be lost any time ``grub2-mkconfig`` is used to regenerate the file.
- Any manual changes to ``/etc/default/grub`` require rebuilding the ```grub.cfg``` file.
