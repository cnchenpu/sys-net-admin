# Final Project 
Pick up a topic, build a team, study it together, share with others.

You can choose any Open Source you like, but it's better to be a system or a toolchain, not just. For example: game, desktop office software, design software, server diagnostic utility, web services, development tools, network security tools...

No number limitation for your team member. Every team will need to present a proposal and demostrate your topic.

## The Proposal Format
- Topic
- Team Leader (name & ID)
- Team Member (name & ID)
- Abstraction
  - Why choose this topic?
  - What are you going to show?
  - What difficulties are you expected to encounter?
